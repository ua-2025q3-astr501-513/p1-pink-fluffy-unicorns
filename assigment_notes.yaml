1. simulate photometry from a transit -- create a boolean mask for a star-planets -- Nina
  a. must be able to include non-spherical planets (like a pink fluffy unicorn) 
      -- (0) lipika will create boolean mask of unicorn
  b. must be able to include sun spots too
2. someone figure out how to simulate limb-darkening or alternate transits -- maybe figure out non-spherical masks
3. someone fits real data (stat and analysis) -- Adi
4. someone build an interpolation to fill in missing data -- Lipika
5. exoplanet atmosphere --Lael
